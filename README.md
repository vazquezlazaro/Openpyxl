# Openpyxl

***
Problem: How you would code a solution for the following problem: <br />
a.            Spreadsheet with 10 columns and 10 rows <br />
b.            I need you to fill in each cell or intersection of the columns and rows with an increasing number (from left to right, top to bottom â€“ fill in with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc..
***

I started with some research and found that Openpyxl was great with manipulating spreadsheets.
After reading the documentation on how to input data into the cells I knew I could just create two For loops to complete this problem. 

To execute: (if openpyxl is not install on your machine)
```
pip3 install openpyxl
```
Otherwise
```
python3 spreadsheet.py
```

Output:
